## Hardware and Software Requirements

The SDAccel tutorials are designed to work with Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs. The tutorials have been verified on `provide details of boards tested or recommended` boards. Xilinx [SDSoC 2018.2 Development Environment](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/sdx-development-environments.html) is required to work with the tutorials.
